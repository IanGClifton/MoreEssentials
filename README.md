Source code used in More Essential Android App Development LiveLessons

The "empty-project" directory includes the base code that the video started with. This is essentially a couple of activities and a bunch of empty fragments in order to organize everything. You can follow along with the videos by starting with this empty project, or you can easily create your own project and simply make whatever fragments and activities you need.

The "complete-project" directory contains the final source code at the end of the video series. Additional comments have been added to each of the lesson fragments to emphasize some of the important points from each lesson.
